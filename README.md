# 🚢 Titanic Survival EDA – Elevate Labs Internship (Task 5)

This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset for Task 5 of the Elevate Labs Internship. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in passenger survival using statistical techniques, visual storytelling, and feature engineering.

## 📊 Highlights of the Analysis

- Cleaned and imputed missing values (Age, Fare, Embarked).
- Univariate analysis: Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass, Embarked, etc.
- Bivariate analysis: Survival by Gender, Class, Age, Fare, Deck.
- Multivariate analysis with correlation heatmaps and pairplots.
- Feature engineering: Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, AgeBin, FareBin.
- Rule-based prediction created and saved for testing.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Females had higher survival rates than males.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Passengers who paid more (Fare) had better survival chances.
- Being alone negatively affected survival.
- Titles like Miss/Mrs showed survival differences.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Missingno (for null visualizations)
